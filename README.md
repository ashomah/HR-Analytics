This case study aims to model the probability of attrition of each employee from the *HR Analytics Dataset*, [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lnvardanyan/hr-analytics). Its conclusions will allow the management to understand which factors urge the employees to leave the company and which changes should be made to avoid their departure.

All the files of this project are saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashomah/HR-Analytics).
